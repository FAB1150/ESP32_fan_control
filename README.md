# Temperature fan control with an ESP32

A simple way to output a PWM signal based on temperature readings by a thermistor

## What you need:
* An [ESP32][link1]
* A PWM fan (or anything that accepts a PWM signal that you want to control)
* A [voltage regulator][link2] for the ESP32 (if you have a 12V fan)
* An [NTC thermistor][link3] (take one from a 3D printer hotend), preferrably a 100K 3950
* A 100K立 resistor
* A pull-down resistor (1K立 is fine)
* A 12V voltage source (or 5V for 5V fans)
* Some free time

#### notes:
* [Check the pinout of your ESP32][link4] to avoid headaches! Not all boards are the same!
* If you want to put everything on a breadboard, the ESP32s without silkscreen legends are thinner
* If you use 12V fans, the voltage regulators linked above are configurable. Get a thin blade and some solder
* If you use small 5V fans you don't need to step down the voltage and can just use a 5V supply for everything
* the thermistor resistor isn't necessarily 100K立, use the [voltage divider equation][link5] to find an appropriate resistor (we'll set this up in the code). Usually a resistor with the same value as the thermistor is good

## Getting Started
* download pwm_fan_control.ino from its folder and open it with the arduino IDE
* Wire everything up
* set up the code and flash it to the ESP32
* if you don't know how to flash to the ESP32 from Arduino IDE, follow [this tutorial][link6] to get started
* you're done!

## Wiring
Wiring everything up is fairly easy, as you can usually do everything on one side of the ESP32. Again, make sure to [check the pinout of your board][link4], as some have the 3V3 output on the other side!

Follow this image for reference:
![Breadboard][img1]

* note that in this image the bottom rail in the breadboard has 12V, and the top rail is 5V. Don't mix them up!
* the pin next to the 5V input is NOT a ground! it doesn't say GND, but CMD. follow the diagram in the image above!
* By default, the fan PWM output (green wire) is on pin GPIO35, and the thermistor input (brown wire) is on pin GPIO25. Check where the pins are on your board, as some have them scrambled in different places. If you choose differents pins, you can edit the default ones in the next step. For the thermistor input, make sure to [choose a pin][link4] connected to the ADC (ADCx_y in the website's image)
* The pull-down resistor (connected to the green wire) isn't strictly necessary, but if you don't use it some fans might misbehave
* The 100K立 resistor goes between 3V and the thermistor, as in this image:
![thermistor][img2]
* You need to set up the voltage regulator for 5V. To do this, cut the little trace over the ADJ pad with an xacto knife (circled in the image), and bridge the two pads for 5V. If you plan on modifying the project a bit, remember that these voltage regulators can't boost the voltage, only step it down! If you need to go up, buy a different one.
* The Enable pin of the regulator will stay discconnected, as the regulator can stay on all of the time.

* be careful with connecting the fan wires correctly! the PWM signal wire is NOT next to the power wires, but the one on the other side of the connector! be careful or you will fry your esp32!

## Set up the code
We're almost done! Now you need to set up the code:
* After downloading it, open pwm_fan_control.ino with the Arduino IDE
* If you have never used an ESP32 with the Arduino IDE yet, follow [this tutorial][link6] to get started. Now that you see the esp32 code correctly, we can go on editing our settings.
* define the correct pins by editing these two variables, if you used the same pins as me you don't have to modify this

``` arduino
//setting the I/O pins
  //the output pin
    const int fanOutput = 32;
  //thermistor pin
    const int thrm = 25;
```
* 


\#todo
define the correct pins
calibrate thermistor (website reference). Decomment #define DEBUG!!
set up the temperatures, max and min PWM, curve shape
